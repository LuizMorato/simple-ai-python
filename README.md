# Python AI Project: Artificial Intelligence and Predictions

This project aims to create an artificial intelligence model to predict the credit score of bank customers. Using machine learning techniques, we will analyze customer information and classify them into credit score categories: Poor, Fair, or Good.

## Case: Customer Credit Score
Imagine you have been hired by a bank to develop a system capable of automatically assessing the credit risk of its customers. Based on a set of historical data about customers and their financial behaviors, the goal is to build a model that can predict the credit score of new customers.
